Implementation TODO:

- Update the database to use intent based model (question should have an intent attribute for sorting by intent/topic)
- Add the administrative web page.
- Bert question answering for IT related issues.
- Add the strategies for each intent
- Possibly remove the conversation state in favor of submitting feedback/reviews for a specific question and rejecting it if a review already exists.

Low Priority: Fix concurrency issues
