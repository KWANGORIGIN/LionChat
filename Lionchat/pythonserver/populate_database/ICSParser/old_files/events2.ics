 gh the United Nations World Food Programme to combat food insecurity acro
 ss the globe. \n\nCrisis Text Line:  \n\n Become a volunteer to help the 
 Crisis Text Line offer free\, 24/7 support for those in crisis. If you ca
 n commit to volunteering four hours each week\, you can apply to be train
 ed for free.  \n\nSmithsonian Digital Volunteer:  \n\nThe Smithsonian Ins
 titution is the world’s largest museum\, education\, and research complex

 r artifacts and research. \n\n 7 Cups: \n\n7 Cups provides free\, 24/7 em
 otional support to millions via online chat. All you need is an internet 
 connection and you can sign up for their trainings\, then you can help pr
 ovide emotional support to people!  \n\nBe My Eyes: \n\nBe My Eyes is a f
 ree mobile app designed to make the world more accessible for blind and l
 ow-vision people by connecting them with sighted volunteers from all over
  the world through a live video call. Read a card\, check an expiration d
 ate\, or describe items on a shelf! \n\nProject Gutenburg:  \n\nFounded i
 n 1971\, the goal of Project Gutenburg is to create the largest digital l
 ibrary. So far they’ve amassed 59\,000 free eBooks. You can volunteer by 
 donating eligible materials\, transcribing books into a digital form\, or
  proofreading others’ work.  \n\nCharity Miles \n\nThis free app is great
  to use for all your indoor or outdoor walks and runs! With a variety of 
 charities to choose from (Autism Speaks\, Feeding America\, Habitat for H
 umanity\, Wounded Warrior Project\, and lots more) you’re sure to get inv
 ested. For every mile you move\, you help earn money for your charity fro
 m the corporate sponsorship pool. You can also get sponsored by your frie

 ey while you’re at it!  \n\nTranslators Without Borders \n\nThis non-prof
 it working towards a world where knowledge knows no language barriers. If
  you speak more than one language\, your knowledge is extremely valued! A
  sign that reads “Wash Your Hands for at Least 20 Seconds” means nothing 
 if it isn’t in your language. Help medical workers by translating materia
 ls online.  \n\nBox Tops for Education \n\nDownload the free Box Tops app
  to scan grocery receipts and earn money for the school of your choice! T
 he app keeps track of your totals\, the school’s yearly goal\, and makes 
 sure the funding gets directly to the school administrators.  \n\n2020 Ce
